Welcome to the Hugo Engineering Challenge

The purpose of this test is to provide a sample of your ability to solve common problems in full-stack engineering. All code must be written in a "production" fashion, following good practices with appropriate commentary, well defined interfaces, etc.

Treat the interviewer that sent you this test as a "Product Representative" and ask as many questions as you need in order to do your best to solve the problems assigned you. The quantity, frequency, and quality of questions will never be held against you in any way, shape, or form; so, ask!
Given

    Remotely hosted data
        Poverty data per state: https://static.withhugo.com/tests/data/poverty.json
        Population data per state: https://static.withhugo.com/tests/data/population.json
    Locally hosted data
        Uninsured driver percentages by state: data/uninsured_by_state.json

You will use all sets of data to implement the needed behavior. Some sample code for basic data retrieval from a remote location has been provided. You will need to supply additional code to complete the challenge.
Code rules

    Move, change, rename, do anything you need to do to reflect your ability to build professional, maintainable, high quality code
    Try to not pull in large frameworks (Angular, Vue, etc.) as the goal is for you to keep the code as vanilla as possible -- and for the test to NOT take a very long time (we know working with vanilla Bootstrap and jQuery can get messy -- do your best to keep it simple and organized on the front-end)
    Feel free to restyle the code, we just automatically put it in our standard coding style

Stories

    As a user, I would like to see a table containing information about each state so that I may quickly and easily browse through the data.

    As a user, I would like a card above the table indicating the state with the highest population in poverty so that I may better understand the data.

    As a user, I would like a card above the table indicating the states with the top 3 uninsured populations by uninsured population size so that I may quickly understand which states have the most uninsured drivers.

    As a user, I would like a card above the table indicating the state with the highest percentage of its population in poverty so that I may better understand the data.

    As a user, I would like a card above the table indicating the state with a 0 to 17 in poverty population count closest to the national mean 0 to 17 in poverty population count so that I may better understand the data.
